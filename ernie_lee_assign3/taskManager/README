	Develop a text based dashboard for a TaskManager. There are three tabs on the dashboard for this assignment.
     Processes tab has the following information: ProcessName, UserName, CP, Memory, Description
     Performance tab has the following information; Current Memory usage, current CPU usage. Total Physical memory, Total Cached.
     Users tab has the following information: userName, status.
     
     The format of the data is as follows:
     	Process Name: value	|	User Name: value-status_value	|	CPU: value	|	Memory: value	|	Description: value
		Total Memory: value	|	Total Cache: value
